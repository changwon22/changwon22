# 👋 Hi, I'm Changwon Lee

🎓 I'm a **MS-Research Student** in **Industrial & Systems Engineering** at the **University of Wisconsin–Madison**, advised by [Professor Jeff Linderoth](https://jlinderoth.github.io/).

---

## 🧠 Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in the **intersection between Optimization and Machine Learning**, focusing on how mathematical optimization can enhance learning algorithms and model interpretability.

---

## 🔬 Current Work

I'm currently working on a project that explores the **Maximizing Sparsity Problem in Neural Networks** using a **Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)** framework.  
This work aims to bridge **discrete optimization techniques** with **discrete/continuous decision modeling** to achieve efficient and explainable neural architectures.

## 💻 Skills & Tools

- **Optimization:** MIP, LP, MILP, Branch-and-Bound, Duality  
- **Machine Learning:** Neural Networks, Sparse Models, Kernel Methods  
- **Programming:** Python, Julia (JuMP), LaTeX  
- **Solvers:** Gurobi, SCIP(Learning)
